About Me
======
I am Tomoya Wakayama, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at the Graduate School of Economics, The University of Tokyo. My research interests lie in Bayesian inference, Bayesian deep learning, and spatial statistics.

Research Highlights
------
- Developed a novel Bayesian trend filtering method for functional data
- Investigated the conditions for perfect classification in functional data analysis
- Proposed a spatiotemporal factor model for large-scale data with applications in population map forecasting

------
- Ph.D. in Statistics (Expected), The University of Tokyo, 2024
- M.S. in Statistics, The University of Tokyo, 2021
- B.S. in Mathematics, The University of Tokyo, 2019
